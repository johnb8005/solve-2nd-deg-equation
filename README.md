This is an example project that goes through the different steps of designing a piece of software, namely:
* turning logic into an algorithm
* test
* add UI
* create a version
* [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
* version management, [semver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Sequence-based_identifiers)
* deploy <=> [CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment)
